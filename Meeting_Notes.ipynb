    "### Steps to do:\n",
    "- [x] Plot individual component of portfolio\n",
    "- [x] Plot delta hedging trajectory\n",
    "- [ ] Add small Gaussian error to each paramater and see how it affects delta hedging error\n",
    "- [ ] Use squared log return for estimator for volatility vs true volatility (since IRL we don't know true vol)\n",
    "    - Want to smooth return before using it for estimator so it's independent of vol of vol\n",
    "- [ ] Implement clipping smoother from class\n",
    "    - [ ] Change $\\theta$ or $\\sigma$ to see which has more effect on smoothing\n",
    "    - [ ] If increase $\\kappa$ and $\\theta$ together, expect less effectiveness because higher mean-reversion rate\n",
    "- [ ] Use elastic net estimator and derive influence function"
